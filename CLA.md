Thank you for your interest in contributing to software projects managed by Asayer, Inc. (“We” or “Us”). This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) documents the rights granted by contributors to Us.

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, no charge and royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Copyright covering the Contribution, with the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Contribution as part of the Work; provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

#### 2.2 Patent License

For patent claims, including without limitation method, process, and apparatus claims which You (or Your Affiliates, as may be applicable) own, control or have the right to grant, now or in the future, You grant to Us, and to recipients of software distributed by the Us, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, no charge and royalty-free, irrevocable patent license, with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution (and the Contribution in combination with the Work, and portions of such combination). This license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the licensed rights infringes such patent claims; and provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3. If any person or entity institutes patent litigation against Contributor or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Contributions, or the Work to which the Contributions were submitted, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted under this Agreement for that Contribution to the person or entity instituting the litigation, or the Work to which the Contributions were submitted, shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

#### 2.3 Outbound License

Based on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 (meaning, no matter what, you can keep licensing your Contribution to others however you want) and 2.2, if We include Your Contribution in any Work, and if We determine that it is appropriate for the purpose of commercializing any Work or any project under Our control, we may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses.

#### 2.5 Our Rights

You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of any Work, and that we and may decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.

#### 2.6 Reservation of Rights

Any rights in Your Contribution not expressly licensed under this Agreement are expressly reserved by You.

### 3. Representations

You represent (promise) that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Us, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate Contributor License Agreement with Us.

You further represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

### 4. Disclaimer

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 3, YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". YOU EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

### 5. Miscellaneous

5.1 This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The sole venue for all disputes relating to this Agreement shall be in the New Castle County, Delaware (USA). The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

5.2 This Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.

5.3 The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.

5.4 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.

**This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.**

By signing this agreement, Contributor accepts and agrees to the preceding terms and conditions for Contributor’s present and future Contributions submitted to Us.
